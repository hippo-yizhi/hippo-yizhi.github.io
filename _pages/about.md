Welcome to my personal site! I'm Yizhi Wang, a current Master’s student in Computer Engineering at Columbia University, where I explore the intersections of cloud computing, hardware security, and blockchain technology. Previously, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Ohio State University, graduating Cum Laude with a solid foundation in operating systems, computer architecture, and software design.

### Interests
I am passionate about leveraging emerging technologies to solve real-world problems, particularly in secure, cloud-based architectures and assistive technology. As I continue my studies and projects, I am excited about opportunities to advance my expertise in computer engineering and contribute meaningfully to the field.


### Education
- **Columbia University, New York, NY**  
  Master of Science in Computer Engineering, GPA 3.6/4.0 (Expected Dec 2024)  
  *Courses include*: Algorithms, Cloud Computing, Formal Verifications, Blockchain, Database, Embedded Systems

- **Ohio State University, Columbus, OH**  
  Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering, GPA 3.5/4.0  
  *Honors*: Cum Laude, Dean’s List (Spring 2020, Autumn 2020, Spring 2021, Autumn 2021, Spring 2022)  

### Skills
My technical skill set spans programming languages such as C++, Python, and Java, and extends to embedded development, AI, cloud computing, and security. I’m also adept with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, QEMU, AWS, and various debugging and network monitoring tools.

### Research & Projects
#### ARM TrustZone Streaming Client Project
Designed and implemented a secure video streaming client using ARM TrustZone (TZ) technology, emphasizing confidentiality and efficient data decryption. Leveraged the OP-TEE framework to manage secure communications between the Trusted Execution Environment and the Rich Application environment.

#### Online Job Search Platform
Collaborated to build a job search platform on AWS, integrating modular microservices and S3 storage to ensure security, real-time updates, and efficient data management.

#### Formal Verification Proxy Server Project
Contributed as a developer to create a stable, efficient proxy server supporting multithreaded, secure client-server communication. Focused on formal verification using Promela and SPIN, enhancing system reliability through verified safety and liveness properties.

#### Smart Assistive Cane Design
Developed a smart assistive cane application using ROS, integrated with motion planning algorithms, and deployed on Raspberry Pi for state estimation and action controls.
