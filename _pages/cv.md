### Blockchain-based Content Distribution Verification Mechanism
**Columbia University** <span style="float: right; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">Aug 2024 – Dec 2024</span>
- Designed and implemented a blockchain-based content distribution verification mechanism with Python, which integrates blockchain and Merkle Tree technologies to ensure data integrity and security in a content delivery network (CDN)
- Developed a decentralized solution utilizing Proof of Work (PoW) and Merkle Trees for real-time data validation and tamper detection, ensuring the reliability of content delivered across distributed nodes
- Simulated a CDN network that successfully verified and distributed content, incorporating blockchain for trust and Merkle Trees for efficient data integrity checks, demonstrating robust handling of data tampering and repair

### Reinforcement Learning - Emotion Propagation
**Columbia University** <span style="float: right; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">Aug 2024 – Dec 2024</span>
- Developed EmotionWorld 2D environment and optimized emotion propagation using Python and Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning, simulating emotion diffusion in social networks
- Leveraged DQN and graph theory to model emotion propagation dynamics, incorporating personalized emotion parameters (e.g., spread rate, duration, and radius) and utilizing experience replay and target Q-networks to train agents for optimal emotion spreading
- Visualized the emotion propagation process in real-time with Pygame, fine-tuned the model through hyperparameter adjustments, and enhanced performance and stability through Epsilon exploration-exploitation strategies

### ARM TrustZone Streaming Client Project (Hardware Security)
**Columbia University** <span style="float: right; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">Jan 2024 – Aug 2024</span>
- Designed and implemented a secure streaming media client using C++ based on ARM TrustZone (TZ) technology to ensure the confidentiality of video content
- Developed a Rich Application (RA) to receive encrypted video streams from the server and pass them to the Trusted Application (TA) for decryption
- Created the TA application to securely store the private key and provide video decryption functionality, leveraging the OP-TEE framework to simulate the communication between TEE and Rich Execution Environment

### Formal Verification (CDN Proxy System)
**Columbia University** <span style="float: right; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">Aug 2023 – Dec 2023</span>
- Utilized Promela language and SPIN model checker to perform formal verification of a CDN proxy system, ensuring the security and stability of multithreaded concurrent communication
- Validated the system’s safety properties (e.g., preventing deadlocks, ensuring mutual exclusion, avoiding message corruption) and liveness properties (e.g., message retransmission), enhancing system reliability and fault tolerance
- Designed and verified a proxy system handling multiple concurrent client requests, addressing DNS load balancing and thread synchronization issues, and used SPIN for state-space exploration to detect and resolve potential deadlocks and resource conflicts, improving system efficiency and error detection

### Build an Online Job Search Platform
**Columbia University** <span style="float: right; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">Aug 2023 – Dec 2023</span>
- Crafted an intuitive user interface with customizable features through the AWS Management Console with a group
- Leveraged Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3) as the primary storage mechanism for all application data and Python as the implementation language, ensuring high security, real-time updates, and efficient data management
- Adopted a modular approach by designing and deploying different modular using AWS microservices

### GAN - Adding Noise to Discriminator
**Ohio State University** <span style="float: right; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">Jan 2022 – Dec 2022</span>
- Developed an automated fuzzing system to enhance image quality by dynamically adding noise to the discriminator and implementing a feedback mechanism to adjust noise based on model performance, optimizing the training process
- Created training and testing datasets in Python with defined epochs and learning rates for both the generator and discriminator
- Monitored and analyzed loss trends to evaluate the impact of noise on the discriminator’s ability to improve generated image quality

### Anti-Racist: Air Quality Analysis and Awareness Project
**Ohio State University** <span style="float: right; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">Aug 2022 – Dec 2022</span>
- Collected particulate matter data across 14 zip code regions in Columbus, OH using GP2Y1010AU0F and KEYESTUDIO PM2.5 sensors
- Analyzed air quality disparities between affluent, predominantly white neighborhoods and underserved, racially diverse communities
- Built an interactive website to visualize collected data, explain project findings, and provide resources for community-led studies

### Smart Cane (Assistive Technology)
**Cornell University** <span style="float: right; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">June 2022 – July 2022</span>
- Developed and integrated a Robot Operating System (ROS) embedded system using Raspberry Pi to control ultrasonic sensors, vibration motors, and cameras for real-time navigation and obstacle detection for blind users
